## Special files
* `makeit` is a bash script I have written to automate compiling and preparing output of the programs.
* `new-project` is also another bash script to speed up coding. You can safely ignore this file. Don't execute the file unless you know what you are doing.
* `rename-project` renames a source-code-folder, and the .cpp, .html, etc file inside it. You can safely ignore this file.
* `input.txt` is a file inside every source-code-folder that is automatically input to the compiled program (cpp only) by 'makeit' and the output is stored in the source-code-folder as output.txt.
* `make-complete-pdf` is used to create a single PDF by combining all pdfs from subfolders.
* `make-cover-pdf` used to create cover page of complete pdf.

  Run `command help` to know more about those commands.
