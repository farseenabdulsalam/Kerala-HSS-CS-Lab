<h2>Special files</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>makeit</code> is a bash script I have written to automate compiling and preparing output of the programs.</li>
<li><code>new-project</code> is also another bash script to speed up coding. You can safely ignore this file. Don&#39;t execute the file unless you know what you are doing.</li>
<li><code>rename-project</code> renames a source-code-folder, and the .cpp, .html, etc file inside it. You can safely ignore this file.</li>
<li><code>input.txt</code> is a file inside every source-code-folder that is automatically input to the compiled program (cpp only) by &#39;makeit&#39; and the output is stored in the source-code-folder as output.txt.</li>
<li><code>make-complete-pdf</code> is used to create a single PDF by combining all pdfs from subfolders.</li>
<li><code>make-cover-pdf</code> used to create cover page of complete pdf.</li>
</ul>

<p>Run <code>command help</code> to know more about those commands.</p>
