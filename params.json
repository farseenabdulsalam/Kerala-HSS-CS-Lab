Code, Name, Basic Pay, DA, HRA, PF\r\n    read the details of an employee and calculate his net salary\r\n  * Sum Of Digits - Read a number, output the sum of digits of that number\r\n  * Sum Of Squares - Display the sum of squares of first N natural numbers\r\n  * Swap - Program to swap the contents of two variables with a user defined\r\n    function\r\n  * Switch Case 01 - Input a group code and print respective subject name using\r\n    switch case\r\n * HTML\r\n  Pending\r\n * SQL\r\n  Pending\r\n * PHP\r\n  Pending\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n * [Click here to download] (https://github.com/farseenabdulsalam/Kerala-HSS-CS-Lab/zipball/master/) all files in a zip file\r\n * [Click here to download] (https://github.com/farseenabdulsalam/Kerala-HSS-CS-Lab/raw/master/cpp/PDF/CPP.pdf) CPP.pdf which contains all C++ program source code and output.\r\n\r\n I'll upload other files when I get free time\r\n\r\n## Special files\r\n* `makeit` is a bash script I have written to automate compiling and preparing output of the programs.\r\n  Syntax:\r\n  ```\r\n    ./makeit [output-type] [project-folder]\r\n\r\n    output-type is either cpp(for cpp folder only), output, pdf or all\r\n      cpp     -- compile cpp files\r\n      output  -- create output from the program (compiled program for cpp)\r\n                 and `input.txt` file\r\n      pdf     -- a pdf containing source code and output\r\n      all     -- all of the above\r\n\r\n      if output-type is absent, all is assumed\r\n\r\n    [project-folders] is a list of the names of the project folders,\r\n    seperated by space. if absent, all projects is assumed\r\n\r\n    example: ./makeit all array1\r\n  ```\r\n  Students need not worry about this file.\r\n\r\n  If you have a linux system, you can modify input, open a terminal in the folder containing makeit and type ./makeit to create new output\r\n\r\n* `new-project` is also another bash script to speed up coding. You can safely ignore this file. Don't execute the file unless you know what you are doing.\r\n* `rename-project` renames a source-code-folder, and the .cpp, .html, etc file inside it. You can safely ignore this file.\r\n* `input.txt` is a file inside every source-code-folder that is automatically input to the compiled program by 'makeit' and the output is stored in the source-code-folder as output.txt.\r\n* `make-complete-pdf` is used to create a single PDF by combining all pdfs from subfolders.\r\n* `make-cover-pdf` used to create cover page of CPP.pdf.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Work in progress\r\n * [x] C++ Completed.\r\n * [ ] SQL Pending\r\n * [ ] PHP Pending\r\n * [ ] HTML Pending\r\n\r\n\r\n## Enquiries\r\nIf you need more programs, you can open an issue, open a pull request or mail me at farseenabdulsalam@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nYou can download, modify and freely distribute these as long as you adhere by the license.\r\nSee [LICENSE.txt] (https://github.com/farseenabdulsalam/Kerala-HSS-CS-Lab/raw/master/LICENSE.txt) for more information.\r\n\r\n## My Other Works\r\n#####[Click here] (http://farseenabdulsalam.github.io) to view my other works\r\n","google":"UA-72257725-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
