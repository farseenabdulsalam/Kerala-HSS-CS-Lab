You can safely ignore this file. Don't execute the file unless you know what you are doing.\r\n* `rename-project` renames a source-code-folder, and the .cpp, .html, etc file inside it. You can safely ignore this file.\r\n* `input` is a file inside every source-code-folder that is automatically input to the compiled program by 'makeit' and the output is stored in the source-code-folder itself\r\n\r\n\r\n## Work in progress\r\n* C++ is completed.\r\n* SQL, PHP and HTML pending.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Enquiries\r\nIf you need more programs, you can open an issue, open a pull request or mail me at farseenabdulsalam@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nYou can download, modify and freely distribute these as long as you adhere by the license.\r\n","google":"UA-72257725-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
