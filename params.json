You can safely ignore this file. Don't execute the file unless you know what you are doing.\r\n* `rename-project` renames a source-code-folder, and the .cpp, .html, etc file inside it. You can safely ignore this file.\r\n* `input.txt` is a file inside every source-code-folder that is automatically input to the compiled program by 'makeit' and the output is stored in the source-code-folder as output.txt.\r\n* `make-complete-pdf` is used to create a single PDF by combining all pdfs from subfolders.\r\n* `make-cover-pdf` used to create cover page of CPP.pdf.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Work in progress\r\n- [x] C++ is completed.\r\n- [ ] SQL\r\n- [ ] PHP\r\n- [ ] HTML\r\n\r\n\r\n## Enquiries\r\nIf you need more programs, you can open an issue, open a pull request or mail me at farseenabdulsalam@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nYou can download, modify and freely distribute these as long as you adhere by the license.\r\nSee [LICENSE.txt] (https://github.com/farseenabdulsalam/Kerala-HSS-CS-Lab/raw/master/LICENSE.txt) for more information.\r\n\r\n## My Other Works\r\n#####[Click here] (http://farseenabdulsalam.github.io) to view my other works\r\n","google":"UA-72257725-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
